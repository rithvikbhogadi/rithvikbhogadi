# Sample tests for minimal experiments with the ADT interfaces
# The purpose of this file is to give some examples that will help
# with completing the assignment. In particular, examples are given to
# exercise the correct interface.  This should help us prevent the
# frustrating (for everyone!) errors where the syntax of the
# specification is not followed.

# This file may be updated if student questions suggest that another
# example would be helpful.  Therefore, you should avoid writing any
# code in this file that you may want to keep.  If you change this
# file, your changes could be lost when we force push a new version.

# The manual test cases could be made fancier, by adding counters to
# count the total number of tests, passed tests and failed tests.
# Test cases can be added to verify exceptions are generated, if
# you add exceptions to the ADT interface.

# Below are incomplete tests - their purpose is to exercise the
# interface, so that your code will least matches the specified
# interface syntax
